# 6502

## Overview

This repository holds a collection of utilities, tools, and programs designed for a 6502 computer. This hardware project, originally designed by Ben Eater, provides an engaging platform for hands-on exploration of fundamental computer architecture.

## Contents

The repository consists of:

- **pcb:** An EasyEDA project that contains the schematic and PCB I created based off of Ben Eater's design
- **wozmon:** The monitor program originally written for the Apple I updated to support this architecture
- **part*** Other random programs or notes at different stages of the project

## Project Basis

The design of the 6502 Breadboard Computer was inspired by Ben Eater's YouTube video series and his serial interface kit. Visit his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/eaterbc) for a more comprehensive understanding of the project.

## Disclaimer

While these tools have been made publicly available, this repository is primarily a personal hobby project. If you would be interested in printing the PCB or would like the bill of materials, feel free to contact me.
